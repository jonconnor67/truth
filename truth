<p>As we all know, history has a tendency to repeat itself, and this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Quadriserv/AQS, SL-x, and Data Explorers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://archive.is/c0Qt6#selection-1763.0-1823.89" target="_blank">Quadriserv/AQS, SL-x, and Data Explorers</a> situation is definitely not the first time something like this has happened. It perfectly emulates the Cartel from the days of the New York Association when a consortium of the country’s largest financial institutions could shutdown any bank in the nation simply by refusing their services.  In fact, it was this very behavior that eventually went on to become the primary focal point of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Pujo Committee (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pujo_Committee" target="_blank">Pujo Committee</a> in 1913, immediately before the passing of the Federal Reserve Act.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Included below are key excepts from that Committee which will show you the true power of a clearinghouse.   Key quotes from the book, "Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It"(1914), will also be included, and everything has been broken down so it will only take about <em>5 minutes</em> to read.</p>

<p>If somebody were to tell you that you do not technically own your shares in a public company, would you believe them? Probably not, right? That seems rather ridiculous, doesn't it?  Many people have their life-savings invested in the stock market, and how could somebody else own something that you paid for with your own money?  <br><br>Unfortunately it's true, and you are not the legal owner of your investments. It is actually the banks and brokers that are the true legal owners, and you are just issued an entitlement; an unusual relationship that they characterize as "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.is/T1d0Y#selection-1291.0-1294.0" target="_blank">street name</a>" ownership, and all shares are held in book-entry form (electronically) at the DTCC, with the banks and brokers acting as the <em>registered holders</em> on the company's books.</p>

<p>In the age of artificial intelligence, crypto currencies, smart phones and quantum computing, you might be wondering why we still need these brokers and banks to act as the legal owners of our investments. Nobody uses paper certificates anymore, and certainly there should be some kind of SAAS technology out there by now that could solve the liability and book-keeping issues that come with transferring these ownership interests back and forth between accounts.</p>

That word makes it sound much more complicated than it actually is, especially considering all the technology we have today.  Every country in the Western World holds elections, yet for some strange reason, the only place that exhibits such unusual complications is on the stock market; the lifeblood of the American economy.<br><br></p>

<p style="font-size:30px" class="cursive-background-image">(CARL T. HAGBERG AND ASSOCIATES)  "Over-voting is, quite simply, untenable. Allowing it to continue makes a mockery of the idea of corporate democracy. There is ample evidence that people do try to “game” the system, since votes do indeed have value - especially when the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em> voting outcomes have the potential to move the stock price</em></span></strong>, as often they demonstrably do. (See, for example, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=686026&amp;download=yes" target="_blank">“Vote Trading and Information Aggregation”</a></span></strong> which is easily accessible on the Internet and which documents <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>huge spikes in share purchases near meeting record dates and corresponding sales immediately thereafter</em></span></strong>). There is also a great deal of evidence that the “gamesters” quite often succeed in gaming the vote, since, (a) as the study pointed out, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>one can buy votes for about $6 per million votes and </em></span></strong>(b) vote buyers will vote 100% of the time, while long-term owners tend not to vote at all, which allows the voters with “duplicate voting credentials” not just to go undetected, but to have their way in terms of the election outcomes. It is especially important to note in the context of election “gaming” that the interests of short-term and long-term owners are, almost always, diametrically opposed in election contests".  <br><a href="https://archive.is/aUv1B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://archive.is/aUv1B</a><br><a href="http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-14-10/s71410-68.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-14-10/s71410-68.pdf (opens in a new tab)">http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-14-10/s71410-68.pdf</a></p>

<p>You're probably thinking that all those citations are kind of old, and it's been almost 20 years since that NYSE complaint, so something must have been done about this by now -- right?<br><br>Unfortunately, no, and still to this day in the year 2020, nothing has changed.  Just look online and you will see numerous articles and white papers from reputable sources addressing all of the problems outlined in this article.  <br><br>Just last year in 2019, one investor advocacy group sent several letters to the SEC addressing this strange phenomenon of "over-voting<em>"</em>.  <br><br>Strangely, you can't visit their website anymore because this will happen.</p>

Second, Dole closed on the sale of certain banana properties in Latin America. Third, Dole signed a definitive purchase and sale agreement to sell certain property in North America. The sale closed during March 2009. Dole received net cash proceeds of approximately $83 million from these three transactions.

<p>The transaction allowed him and his partners -- the banks -- to maintain a controlling interest in this massive 150 year old company.<br><br>At the time, Dole Foods represented 1/4 of all banana sales worldwide; 131,000 acres of farms and other land holdings; six modern corrugated box manufacturing plants in Latin America and Asia; the largest dedicated refrigerated containerized fleet in the world representing 14,800 refrigerated containers, and 11 owned and 13 chartered vessels.  In short, this was an empire, and you don't just give something like that up easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To keep Murdock in power, they set up an off-balance sheet entity called "<em>MACES Trust</em>", and the deal was that his creditors  would hold on to the stock and use it as collateral for a loan.  Now that the company was public, it was easier to sell this ownership interest, whereas before, finding a buyer could be a long and arduous process.</p>

<p class="red-yellow-background-link">Let's not forget, this is on no capital intensive work or investment whatsoever. Yes, it costs money to run a bank, but nothing like running Dole Foods, the largest producer of fresh produce in the world.<br><br>There is a lot of work, a lot more risk, and hell of a lot more blood, sweat, and tears that goes into bringing the world their fresh produce. As it was noted before, Mr. Murdock clocked 200 km on his corporate jet on any given year, and as to the workers <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="toiling his fields (opens in a new tab)" href="https://archive.is/bylTv#selection-1587.0-1592.0" target="_blank">toiling his fields</a> in those overseas plantations, God only knows how many back breaking steps they had to take in the hot sun just to bring us that fresh fruit. Compared to this -- along with the shipping, planning, training, and all the manpower that goes into Dole -- the banks did virtually nothing for this money.  <br><br>You don't think his creditors wanted to keep Mr. Murdock in power? They still had a lot of money on the line, and there's nothing that a lender hates more than uncertainty.</p>

<p>After fighting to remain in control during the worst financial crisis since the great depression; offering to sell the whole company for as low as $700 million; and setting up this unusual trust entity that allowed him and his bankers to initiate a sort of unregistered mini off-balance sheet side-deal -- strange IPO beside the real IPO kind of transaction ("<em>MACES Trust</em> "); all the while demanding to be addressed simply as "Chairman" at the company board meetings, he then sold his controlling interest, but miraculously bought back the company one year later, AND he got to keep the Wellness Center??</p>

<p>You might also be wondering how he was able to buy it back so easily.

One of them bought 8.3% of the outstanding capital stock only a few weeks before the vote for the sole purpose of filing a suit!<br><br>It was even claimed that his <em>"creditors"</em> (partners) privately believed the company was worth <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.is/t7b2C#selection-4545.0-4548.0" target="_blank">$23 per share</a>, and after all was said and done, the settlement eventually went on to become one of the largest appraisals in Delaware's 118 year history as a corporate tax haven.</p>

<p>The DTCC says they stopped tracking who owned the shares three days before the vote, and that all 12.3 million extra shares somehow just appeared in peoples accounts during this short period of time, but technically we have no way of knowing that.  For all we know, those shares could have been circulating the whole time, because again, they own the clearinghouse, they own the regulators, and they own the banks and brokers that also legally own all the stocks.  <br><br>There is even a chance that the "<em>institutional investors</em> " who purchased those "<em>MACES</em> " decided to hedge their bet by borrowing shares from one of those <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="various pension funds (opens in a new tab)" href="http://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1057/DFCI00_01/2016623_r01c_15CV01140.pdf" target="_blank">various pension funds</a> so they could take a short position, then when it came time  to return the shares, the brokers just credited their accounts. We have no idea, all we know is that there was $167 million worth of extra stock, and for some strange reason their only excuse was that they didn't have the technology or the infrastructure in place to identify who the real owners actually were.</p>

<p>How would reconcile this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's say there was a merger and somebody bought that one share, but there was two shares in circulation at the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How would you reconcile that??</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The broker would give the money back to the person who bought the shares from the short seller, then give the shares back to the original owner. That shouldn't be complicated for these massive corporations, and if it is, we've got a serious problem.   </p>

<p class="red-yellow-background-link">Why should we believe anything these people have to say at this point? The largest bank in America is a<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2019/11/jamie-dimon-tells-60-minutes-hes-a-patriot-theres-good-reason-to-think-hes-a-crime-boss/" target="_blank"> two-time felon</a>. Meaning, the corporation itself was indicted -- not the people who run the corporation, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.is/dmx60" target="_blank">the corporation</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"blue-yellow-background-link"} -->
<p class="blue-yellow-background-link">It makes no sense, but that's what happened.  The guy who headed this corporation through both of these indictments wasn't even fired; he still sits on the board, and he's still the CEO.  <br><br>Here's the worst part.  While his firm was being investigated by the New York Fed, he was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="sat on their board (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2019/12/the-new-york-fed-is-keeping-jpmorgans-secrets-close-to-its-chest/" target="_blank">sitting on their board</a> the entire time -- the only institution in America that is legally allowed the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/openmarketoperations.asp" target="_blank">manipulate the daily interest rate of a government treasury bond</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"blue-yellow-background-link"} -->
<p class="blue-yellow-background-link">You definitely wouldn't want the wrong person in control of something like that, because technically all they would have to do is instruct the New York Fed to buy their treasuries at inflated prices during their intraday Open Market Operations, repeating the cycle over and over again for years on end.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, we will never truly know what happened because they own all the infrastructure that facilitates  these transactions.

It's not a coincidence that the  ITOCHU acquisition occurred right around the time that Murdock transferred the shares from that "<em>Trust Offering</em> " to those "institutional investors"(whoever they are). <br><br>If they cared that much about maintaining control over this massive fruit empire (why wouldn't they), and with 12.3 million extra share <em>entitlements </em>spontaneously appearing in peoples accounts, and when you consider the fact that him and his lenders were shown to have -- by all intensive purposes -- defrauded their investors, why should this be so hard to believe?    Remember, the margin was only 0.9%, and many people were already against this merger before it closed. Three hedge funds even bought shares before the vote for the sole purpose of suing the company for an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="appraisal (opens in a new tab)" href="https://archive.is/Exyc1#selection-4687.0-4694.0" target="_blank">appraisal</a>.<br><br>Another possibility is that somebody shorted fictitious shares during the days leading up to shareholder vote.  As you can see in the chart pictured below, the price temporarily spiked above  $13.50, (the price Murdock paid to buyback the company).  Considering how tight that margin of victory was, this could indicate  somebody knew Murdock was going to win before everybody else, but that's just speculation of course.</p>

But again, we can only speculate at this point because the DTCC and the court of Delaware say it's impossible to truly know who the original <em>entitlement </em>holders are, which thus makes it impossible to know why there was 12.3 million extra "<em>facially eligible</em> " shares  in circulation before the merger, even when it's the largest producer of  fresh produce in the world, founded June 2, 1851, 168 years ago, representing 1/4th of all banana sales worldwide; just like it's impossible to truly know  who made the $305 million in interest during the first two years of Doles existence as a public company. <br><br>It's all just so terribly.....complicated...<br><br>You understand, right?  <br><br><br><br><br>It's.....complicated..<br><br>When they steal money from our grandparents, print fake shares, and issue phony voting cards...<br><br><br><br>It's just ..............................<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>......you wouldn't understand.....<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>It's......<br><br><br><br>......................................."complicated".....</p>

<p>Are you starting to see how easily this system could be manipulated?<br><br>It's important to understand that stock trades are just broker to broker transactions, and all these IOU's are simply credits from one broker to another, with the DTCC acting as their ledger.  Just those six corporation pictured above account for 70% of the prime brokerage industry, and as we noted before, they are the true record holders listed on the company's books.</p>

<p>The origins of ledger accounting stem from the middle-ages when merchants were forced to travel long distances with their gold in hand before a transaction could clear. This was not only very risky, but it also slowed down commerce.<br><br>Ledger accounting eliminated this problem, allowing for contracts to be quickly enforced with the stroke of a pen. Grain could be purchased in Rome in March, baked into bread in Venice, in July, and then the bread could be sold in Constantinople in October—all recorded on the same day in the books at a home office, without anybody leaving their place of origin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the ledger system is based upon trust, and the ability to simply issue credits without actually requiring delivery to facilitate large commercial transactions gives the owner of the ledger a tremendous amount of power, and you certainly wouldn't want <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://interactiveswingtrades.com/scandals/" target="_blank">the wrong people</a> in control of something like that.</p>

<p>Some might argue that new regulations which forced clearing firms to close out failure to delivers after 13 days solved this problem, but as most of us know, there is no industry that is better at finding legal loopholes than Wall Street, and it has already been shown that there exist ways around this forced close out rule.</p>

<p>There is nothing normal about that picture you are seeing. Just to reiterate, a fictitious loan is probably one the worst forms of fraud one can imagine. It would be like loaning someone fake gold, charging them interest, then threatening to seize their assets if they didn't pay you back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since ETF shares are just claims to ownership of an underlying asset, just imagine what would happen if the market were to suddenly collapse while there is potentially as much as 400% more share entitlements circulating at any one moment in time? A run on these ETF's could result in the ETF operator -- in this case State Street -- becoming liable for all these extra ETF shares, or worse, it could cause the institution to go bankrupt.</p>

<p>You might also have noticed that the NSCC (a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation) reported fail to deliver tally doesn't seem to be accounting for all these fake shares for some strange reason, which suggests that all these extra shares are being laundered through the "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ex-clearing (opens in a new tab)" href="https://archive.is/Ko5TF#selection-26579.45-26637.97" target="_blank">ex-clearing</a>" system; which is just industry lingo for trades <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cleared by the brokers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://archive.is/GUNsa#selection-287.0-288.0" target="_blank">cleared by the brokers</a> outside of the DTCC.</p>

<p>It almost seems like the combination of these banks and brokers that came with the elimination of the Glass Steagall Act has resulted in some kind of cultural run-off between the two divisions, where the idea of fractional reserve banking has somehow made its way into the board rooms of these brokerages houses, and they've convinced themselves that extending the existing supply of a corporations outstanding capital stock somehow benefits society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is obvious no pressing need to issue more share entitlements than actually exist in the secondary markets because technically you are not facilitating any kind of tangible business activity.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Short to medium term price fluctuations have very little impact on the actual business operations because by that point the company has already raised the capital, and thus everything that happens after the IPO or secondary offering is simply people passing around their certificates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes it might help to issue extra shares when the price has diverged excessively from its intrinsic value, or to facilitate bidding and selling, but it's nowhere near as important as it is in banking, where you can exponentially increase the amount of productively you can get out of every dollar that is in circulation at any particular moment in time.  <br><br>Through broker to broker transactions, and combined with their complete control over the only centralized clearing mechanism in the country, the current settlement system as it exists today also creates terrifying conflicts of interest.  There is nothing normal about Exchange Traded Funds reporting 8 institutional owners per outstanding share in circulation over a period of 4 years, or assets under management that fall in value by almost twice the rate of gold.  That is the very definition of a Ponzi scheme.<br><br>There is also a risk that all these fake share entitlements could be loaned out -- which again, is probably one of the most egregious forms of financial frauds you could possibly imagine.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in 2008 in the middle of the financial crisis, Marc Cohodes ran one of the most sophisticated short selling hedge funds in America, and he looked poised to make very large profits from his short positions.<br><br>Unfortunately, due to an unusual turn of events, his fund ended up doing the complete opposite of what he and his partners expected, and they were quickly forced into liquidation after 24 years in business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He claims that as the entire market was in freefall, several of his short positions were spontaneously closed out by his broker under what he describes as "mathematically impossible" circumstances, and according to Cohodes, if not for these strange close outs by his broker, his fund would have made upwards of $1 billion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br><br>In this leaked testimony, Mr. Cohodes reveals something stunning.  He says that even after informing his broker of news that he had secured a guarantor who was willing to take ownership of his short positions -- thus transferring liability away from his broker to a third party -- they still closed him out anyways, even going so far as to take full control of his accounts against his will.  <br></p>

<p>Why would anybody do something like that? Someone comes along and says they will act as the guarantor for a customer they've had for 24 years — take all that baggage off their hands — and not only do they say no, but they immediately proceed to take full control of the customers' account and close out all of their positions. You are no longer liable, so what could you possibly have to gain from doing something like that?</p>

<p>In this next section, Cohodes goes on to say that he believes there was a chance that his broker had issued his firm fictitious share entitlements, using an old industry term, "naked short selling", to describe this practice -- a catch phrase created decades ago that has since fallen out of favor in the financial community.</p>

I wanted to ask him, what the fuck is going on, that's what I wanted to ask him, and "What are you doing?" <br><br>Q. Did you want to ask him if they had a naked short position? <br><br>A. Yes, among many things, yes. . I mean, basically the theory was by them putting us out of business, if -- and that's a big "if" because I don't know -- I'm not privy to what they do — by a putting us out of business and forcing us to cover, would that have solved their issue, their naked issue because they had no economic reason to do what they did, and they caused us an awful lot of harm. That's for sure . BY MR. SOMMER:<br><br> Q. Did you try discussing that with ***********? <br><br>A. Yeah, yes, we did. <br><br>Q. And did he ever give you any concrete information in response?<br><br> A. Yeah. The quote he told me, and I'll never forget it, is — he said, "Sometimes when there's a house fire, you end up burning down the block." You know, and what I implied from that was that we were an unintended consequence of what was<br></p>

<p style="font-size:40px" class="back-ground-colour-2">What is a margin call, to your understanding?<br><br> A. Well, there's different well, in general terms, there's a Fed margin call and then there's a house margin call. The house margin call is subject to the house and Fed margin calls, that's nonnegotiable. That's subject to the government. So if you have a Fed margin call, that's the government, and you have to meet it. If you have a house margin call, it tends to be negotiable, and if the house says, you know, there's no negotiation on it, then you got to meet it. <br><br>Q. Well, when you're referring to a house margin call, the house that you're referring to is whoever is extending credit, right <br><br>A. Right, the brokerage firm <br><br>Q. So in the case of the margin calls that faced your firm in September '08, the house was <em>****** </em>&amp; Co., right? <br><br>A. Yes <br><br>Q. What were the what's your understanding of the circumstances that were occurring in the stock market that led to the point where your firm received a margin call, a house margin call from ****** &amp; Co.? <br><br>A. Well, that weekend before, Lehman went bankrupt . I think Lehman went bankrupt or Lehman went bankrupt on a Monday. We had collateral securities and cash at Lehman Brothers International <br><br>Q. Was that in London?<br><br> A. That was in London, LBIE -- that was locked up, confiscated, whatever -- lost access to that. That wasn't a problem. I mean, it was a problem, but it wasn't that big a problem. So I think the markets went down Monday or Tuesday or maybe Wednesday, and then the government, without warning on Wednesday or Thursday, put through a must-cover, that Reg SHO deal must-cover in three days .<br><br> Q. There was an amendment to Reg SHO? <br><br>A. Yes. There was an amendment that was basically put through Wednesday at night, in the middle of the night, and immediately hit the next day. No, you had three days. So then the stocks we were involved in that had that went up. That still wasn't a problem. The next day, the government banned short selling in financials or financial- related, and then the market really went up. And that was the day that they called us and said "We have a problem." We said, "Okay. How do we fix this?" -- <br><br>(continued)<br>A. Yeah, Lehman went bankrupt and the government put through two emergency rules back to back . <br><br>Q. And would it refresh your recollection if I told you that the second one of those, the banning of short selling of approximately 800 stocks, went through late on a Thursday night and was announced or disclosed very early on a Friday morning of the same week that Lehman Brothers failed?<br> <br>A. That's probably right, yes. <br><br>Q. So that problem started all in that week? <br><br>A. Yes. <br><br>Q. And was it over like that week and the next -- so the Friday of that week is when you first had a problem with ***** &amp; Co. telling you <br><br>A. Sort of that Thursday <br><br>Q. -- that you got a house margin call? <br><br>A. Sort of that Thursday, that Friday. And one of the problems was because the stocks they said were acting erratic, they changed the haircuts on our loans, meaning if our multiplier was .15, they'd change it to . 5 . So not only did we have a house call, they said instead of putting up .15, you now have to put up .5. So what should have been a small issue was a huge issue because they changed two things on us -- two things they didn't change, two things changed on it. One, we lost a shitpot full of money; and two, they said because we lost a shitpot full of money, we need to have a whole lot more collateral. So it wasn't a Fed call; it was a house call . <br><br>Q. It started with you losing a bunch of money because the stocks that you were short went way up in value; is that right? <br><br>A. Yes. <br><br>Q. And were some of those stocks among those that the government banned short selling in, some of the stocks you were short in? <br><br>A. Not -- some, but not really. <br><br>It was more other shorts were getting killed in the finance stocks, so they were covering anything that they could. The government tried to basically orchestrate a short squeeze, which they did for two days . <br><br>Q. Is it accurate to say, I mean, just hypothetically on that Friday and not knowing what the future holds, if the stocks that your firm was short had continued to increase at the same rate for the next couple of weeks that your firm could have lost everything on those investments? <br><br>A. That's a stretch, but hypothetically, you could say that. <br><br>Q. And is it also accurate hypothetically to say that if that situation had continued and the stocks that your firm was short continued to go up, that eventually ****** &amp; Co. could be left essentially in a money-losing position where it was losing the money because your firm no longer had any cash? <br><br> THE WITNESS: Well, to frame it, frame the argument, by then, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>we were $2 billion of a fund; we had 2 billion. And coming into that Monday, we were up 30 percent for the year. So we had a pretty big cushion and we were doing well before let's just say the shenanigans went on.</em></span></strong> Hypothetically everything the same, okay, when people say they short stocks they have unlimited risk, I totally get that. The problem began that Monday of that next week when the market completely and utterly fell apart, and as the market was literally going down the drain, our shorts were going through the roof.<br><br> BY MR. FLOREN: Q. The stocks that your firm was shorting? <br><br>A. Yes. <br><br>Q. And you thought that was just really bizarre and should not have been happening, correct? <br><br>A. Mathematically it's impossible for that -- I mean, I can remember them closing us out of American Capital Strategies at $33 on that Monday, and when they stopped doing whatever they had to do, when the smoke cleared, we finished covering the thing four weeks later at 2, something like that. We finished covering it at 2 but they took us out of eighty percent of our position in the thirties, and when they were done, we covered at 2. They took us out of Tempur-Pedic at 16, covered that, the rest of it four weeks later, at 3 . mean, it was insane. So it's kind of like <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I played the entire thing for a complete collapse, got the collapse and was closed out</span></em></strong>, closed out right before and during. And then after they completely did me in, said, "Oh, you know, we'll let you go." <br><br> Q. If  **** &amp; Co. had not made these house calls and had extended you more credit during this time period -- <br><br>A. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We didn't need more credit. All they had to do was not make the house calls.</span></strong> <br><br>Q. But wasn't the credit at issue is the margin requirement of a short position, correct? <br><br>A. There's a Fed call which we were in compliance of -- that's the government and then there's a house call. The house call is at the discretion of the house. And the thing that just gets me to no end was this guy **** was leaving in two weeks . He was retiring in two weeks, and he's the guy who made the call to do us in. And he was two weeks away from retiring. So why wouldn't he just say, "You've been a customer for 24 years. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You pay us $100 million in stock loan fees a year, right? You clearly have it right .</span></strong> " Why did they have to do us in? And this guy was leaving in two weeks. And I begged him -- oh, it's troubling for me but I begged him to leave it alone, but they didn't, so --<br><br> Q. I understand it's upsetting. I'm going to just going to ask you a few more questions about it . I move to strike your last answer -- <br><br>A. Okay. <br><br>Q.  Is it accurate that if ****** &amp; Co. had not made that house call, looking back on it, or had just waited until couple of weeks and not forced your firm to cover its positions, essentially your investment strategy would have proved right and you would have made even more profits from what you already made for the year. <br><br>A. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We probably would have maybe another billion dollars</span></strong>, with a B. We would have made fifty percent more at least . <br><br>Q. Now, you said you had to close out the positions because ****** made you close out, correct? <br><br>A. Yeah. And on those subsequent days, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">they actually took over the accounts. They actually took over them</span></strong>. <br><br>Q. And started buying back the short positions? <br><br>A. Uh-huh. (answering yes, "uh huh")<br><br>Q. Is it accurate that it was also possible to meet the house call by bringing in new capital such as making a cash deposit into the fund? <br><br>A . Possible, yes . <br><br>Q. Now, you said that you were upset that ****  wouldn't return your phone calls during this time period, right? <br><br>A. Upset, that's not even the word I'd use. <br><br>Q. You were very upset? Okay. Do you know whether Mr. **** or his securities lending department had anything whatsoever to do with the house call decision? <br><br>A. I knew the house call was at the discretion of somebody. <br><br>Q. Somebody at ***** &amp; Co., correct ? <br><br>A. Exactly. And I knew that since it was generated by a machine, that if it's generated by somebody, I was hoping someone with reason would have talked to somebody to calm someone down to come up with a plan. <br><br>Q. You don't have any understanding that ****** and the other folks in the securities lending department, are the ones who made this decision about the house call, do you? <br><br>A. I don't think they did it, no. The one that did it was *****. That was the one that did it. It was his call. <br><br>Q. And the way the markets were acting in the stocks that you were investing in, in this week of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and then the following week, had you in your life, either before or since, ever seen a market that acted the way the stock market acted during those weeks? <br><br>A. I was actually working part-time at Merrill Lynch in college and that was when you had the Bunker Hunt silver margin fiacso where they almost bankrupted Bache and a whole bunch of other guys. That was the closest thing I ever saw to it. But basically the world was coming to an end. I mean, totally it was coming to an end. But we were short so much, it was exactly what I had been waiting for. It's exactly what I thought was going to happen. <br><br>Q. So was that the most severe such volatile and -- you described it as "world coming to an end" market that you had ever seen? <br><br>A. Yes. <br><br>Q. And how many days really was it from the beginning of this problem to the end of it with the problem with the margin call from ****** &amp; Co. was your firm -- did your firm and its funds lose most of their money? <br><br>A. Eight days, something like that. But the problem was we were off the house call and we were still salvageable. Sure, we had one fund which was up eighty percent and even with all the damage that was done still closed it up 35, so they couldn't kill that one as hard as they tried. But it's when we got off the house call, they wouldn't let us go. And as I recall, to answer your other thing about infusing money, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BNP was prepared to take all our positions and they wouldn't release them</span></strong>. So I scrambled to find, you know, someone to back us since <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">they wouldn't, and I arranged for BNP to take them and they refused to release them</span></strong></p>

<p>Now here comes the worst part. According to Cohodes, his broker even went so far as to call one of the people who planned to take over his accounts so they could try and talk them out of it, saying Cohodes would be out of business in a few days anyways. <br><br>His broker turned out to be right, but it wasn't because of his poor stock selection. Remember, the entire market was in freefall, and these short positions all crashed soon after, and should have led to, at least according to Cohodes, $1 billion in profits.</p>

<p style="font-size:39px" class="back-ground-colour-2">Q. Did he stop taking your calls at some point? <br><br>A. Yes, yeah. <br><br>Q. Did you try leaving messages with him?<br><br> A. Oh, sure.<br><br> Q. Could you estimate how many messages you left with him? <br><br>A. Maybe fifty. <br><br>Q. He never called you back after that when you left those fifty messages? <br><br>A. No. We had another conversation with him because I had the Farallon guys in the office because they were going to take our positions, and Goldman made an outgoing call to Farallon saying that they shouldn't take our positions. <br><br> Q. That's what Farallon told you? <br><br>A. Uh-huh, that's what the CFO of Farallon told Bill Duhamel when they were in the office, that they made an outgoing call to them and said they shouldn't take Copper River positions because we'll be out of business in a couple days anyway.<br><br> Q. Who is — Bill Duhamel?<br><br> A. Bill Duhamel. <br><br>Q. Who is that? <br><br>A. He used to be a money manager at Farallon in the city. <br><br>Q. Is that someone you knew at the time?<br><br> A. Yes. <br><br>Q. And he's the one who told you that? <br><br>A. Uh-huh, yes. He's the guy who — Acme Capital was considered as Farallon for the book sake .<br><br> Q. And if they had taken some of your positions, would Copper River have been able to survive, in your estimation? <br><br>A. Absolutely. <br><br>Q. And was it your understanding that it was someone on the the prop trading desk who had said what you just described to Farallon? <br><br>A. Yes. <br><br>Q. And did you know, was it told to you who it was on the ***** prop trading desk who said that?<br><br>A. No, because that person wouldn't be around today. <br><br> Q. Did it surprise you that Farallon told you it was someone on the ***** prop trading desk? <br><br> A. Well, again, life-changing events you never forget, which this was. And the market, the stock market, was literally falling apart, going straight down. And our short positions would have benefited hugely by the market falling apart and melting down. But the stocks that we had to cover were all going straight up in violent fashions in a straight down market . So someone was running in front of these trades, someone was. So the fact that the ***** prop desk knew about this is not a surprise to me because I think the guys at **** are common criminals, just common criminals. <br><br>Q. Do you recall mentioning that you — your firm had paid hundreds of millions of dollars to ***** a few minutes ago? <br><br>A. Yes. <br><br>Q. And by paying hundreds of millions of <br><br>Q. Do you recall mentioning that you — your firm had paid hundreds of millions of dollars to **** a few minutes ago? <br><br>A. Yes. <br><br>Q. And by paying hundreds of millions of dollars, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>did you mean paying hundreds of millions of dollars in borrow fees for short stock? </em></span></strong><br><br>A. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Yes. </em></span></strong><br><br>Q. I want to show you one other sentence on page 300 of "Selling America Short, " which was Exhibit 6. This is in the next paragraph in the middle. There's a sentence that says, "Also, we have noticed that they — " do you see where I'm looking now? <br><br>A. Yes. <br><br>Q. "Also, we have noticed that ****** &amp; Co. has sometimes been able to provide locates not available elsewhere." Do you see where I read that? <br><br>A. Yes. <br><br>Q. Was it your regular practice in shorting a stock to contact ****** to try to locate the stock first?  <br><br>(continued) Q. Well, did you have personal -- strike that . Was it your understanding that the firm would contact -- your firm would contact ***** to ask for a locate before shorting a stock? <br><br>A. Absolutely. <br><br>Q. And what's your understanding based on? <br><br>A. That was protocol at the firm. Before we could short any stock, we had to get a locate because naked shorting is illegal. And although we were accused many times by your customer Overstock, or specifically Byrne, of naked shorting, we never, ever, ever, ever shorted a stock we couldn't borrow. <br><br>Q. Okay. And did you find, you, Mr. Cohodes, find that sometimes locates were available at ****** that weren't available at some other clearing firm? <br><br><em>A big argument breaks out; various verbal exchanges and objections -- probably more so than any other time during the deposition <br></em><br>Q. You have spent most of your working life involved in short sales of stocks; is that fair to say? <br><br>A. Yes. <br><br>Q. And you were a managing partner of Copper River Partners in 2006, correct? <br><br>A. Yes. <br><br>Q. Okay. And as part of shorting a stock, it was standard practice in your firm to call up ****** and ask for a locate before shorting the stock; isn't that true? <br><br>A. Call or email, yes. <br><br> Q. And did you find that sometimes ***** was able to provide locates that these other clearing firms couldn't get for you? <br><br>MR. FLOREN: Objection, vague and ambiguous . <br><br><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE WITNESS: Yes. <br></span></em></strong><br>Q. And can you explain to me what your experience was in that regard? A. You know, at the time, you know, I thought that the stock loan department at ****** was the best in the business by far, that they were always able to find borrows when others either couldn't or the borrows were too expensive. And ***** to that end was very good. They always would you know, find borrows. And that ' s what we cared about . We didn't -- it wasn't our business to find out who, what, where, where do you get it from or this, that and the other. If they'd say it's okay to short the stock, we'd short it.<br><br> Q. And is that one of the reasons why you wanted to have them as your clearing firm? <br><br>A. Yes. That was the only reason. That was the only reason.</p>

<p class="blue-yellow-background-link">It seems very likely that Mr. Cohodes' suspicions were correct, and that his broker was reacting to the newly enforced SEC regulations that were meant to restrict "naked" short selling activity in wake of the financial crisis.<br><br>If this is true, it could indicate that his broker might have been issuing his fund fictitious loans that, in the words of Mr. Cohodes, led to the firm profiting to the tune of somewhere around "$100 million in stock loan fees a year" -- but this is purely speculation of course.<br><br>What is also very telling is that these forced close outs -- with apparent foreknowledge of the fact that Cohodes had secured a credible guarantor for his holdings --  seemed so counter-intuitive to the people who were involved in the planned deal that it led to a full grown adult male  running to the bathroom and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="throw up (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.ca/Selling-America-Short-Contrarians-Absurdity-ebook/dp/B003BGUOQK" target="_blank">throwing up</a> in disgust.  </p>

<p>Why would a broker close out one of their best customers after being told that someone was willing to take over ownership and act as a guarantor for positions that seemed poised to deliver up to $1 billion in gains? The market was in collapse, and transferring these short positions to someone else would have -- at least apparently -- relieved them of liability. What could they possibly have to gain from doing something like that? It simply doesn't make any sense.</p>

The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world’s central banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank, in the hands of men like Montague Norman of the the Bank of England, Benjamin Strong of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Charles Rist of the bank of France, and Hjalmar Schact of the Reichsbank, sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasure loans, to&nbsp;<strong><em>manipulate foreign exchanges</em></strong>, to influence to the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world.

<p style="font-size:29px" class="cursive-background-image-2"><em>“The goose that lays golden eggs has been considered a most valuable possession. But even more profitable is the privilege of taking the golden eggs laid by somebody else’s goose. The investment bankers and their associates now enjoy that privilege. They control the people through the people’s own money. If the bankers’ power were commensurate only with their wealth, they would have relatively little influence on American business. Vast fortunes like those of the Astors are no doubt regrettable. They are inconsistent with democracy. They are unsocial. And they seem peculiarly unjust when they represent largely unearned increment. But the wealth of the Astors does not endanger political or industrial liberty. It is insignificant in amount as compared with the aggregate wealth of America, or even of New York City. It lacks significance largely because its owners have only the income from their own wealth. The Astor wealth is static. The wealth of the Morgan associates is dynamic. The power and the growth of power of our financial oligarchs comes from wielding the savings and quick capital of others. In two of the three great life insurance companies the influence of J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. and their associates is exerted without any individual investment by them whatsoever. Even in the Equitable, where Mr. Morgan bought an actual majority of all the outstanding stock, his investment amounts to little more than one-half of one per cent. of the assets of the company. The fetters which bind the people are forged from the people’s own gold”.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":29,"className":"cursive-background-image-2"} -->
<p style="font-size:29px" class="cursive-background-image-2"><em>“But the reservoir of other people’s money, from which the investment bankers now draw their greatest power, is not the life insurance companies, but the banks and the trust companies. Bank deposits represent the really quick capital of the nation. They are the life blood of businesses. Their effective force is much greater than that of an equal amount of wealth permanently invested. The 34 banks and trust companies, which the Pujo Committee declared to be directly controlled by the Morgan associates, held $1,983,000,000 in deposits. Control of these institutions means the ability to lend a large part of these funds, directly and indirectly, to themselves; and what is often even more important, the power to prevent the funds being lent to any rival interests. These huge deposits can, in the discretion of those in control, be used to meet the temporary needs of their subject corporations. When bonds and stocks are issued to finance permanently these corporations, the bank deposits can, in large part, be loaned by the investment bankers in control to themselves and their associates; so that securities bought may be carried by them, until sold to investors. Or these bank deposits may be loaned to allied bankers, or jobbers in securities, or to speculators, to enable them to carry the bonds or stocks. Easy money tends to make securities rise in the market. Tight money nearly always makes them fall. The control by the leading investment bankers over the banks and trust companies is so great, that they can often determine, for a time, the market for money by lending or refusing to lend on the Stock Exchange. In this way, among others, they have power to affect the general trend of prices in bonds and stocks. Their power over a particular security is even greater. Its sale on the market may depend upon whether the security is favored or discriminated against when offered to the banks and trust companies, as collateral for loans”.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":29,"className":"cursive-background-image-2"} -->
<p style="font-size:29px" class="cursive-background-image-2"><em>“Furthermore, it is the investment banker’s access to other people’s money in controlled banks and trust companies which alone enables any individual banking concern to take so large part of the annual output of bonds and stocks. The banker’s own capital, however large, would soon be exhausted. And even the loanable funds of the banks would often be exhausted, but for the large deposits made in those banks by the life insurance, railroad, public service, and industrial corporations which the bankers also control. On December 31, 1912, the three leading life insurance companies had deposits in banks and trust companies aggregating $13,839,189.08. As the Pujo Committee finds:”The men who through their control over the funds of our railroads and industrial companies are able to direct where such funds shall be kept and thus to create these great reservoirs of the people’s money, are the ones who are in position to tap those reservoirs for the ventures in which they are interested and to prevent their being tapped for purposes of which they do not approve. The latter is quite as important a factor as the former. It is the controlling consideration in its effect on competition in the railroad and industrial world”.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":29,"className":"cursive-background-image-2"} -->
<p style="font-size:29px" class="cursive-background-image-2"><em>“But the power of the investment banker over other people’s money is often more direct and effective than that exerted through controlled banks and trust companies. J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. achieve the supposedly impossible feat of having their cake and eating it too. They buy the bonds and stocks of controlled railroads and industrial concerns, and pay the purchase price; and still do not part with their money. This is accomplished by the simple device of becoming the bank of deposit of the controlled corporations, instead of having the company deposit in some merely controlled bank in whose operation others have at least some share. When J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. buy an issue of securities the purchase money, instead of being paid over to the corporation, is retained by the banker for the corporation, to be drawn upon only as the funds are needed by the corporation. And as the securities are issued in large blocks, and the money raised is often not all spent until long thereafter, the aggregate of the balances remaining in the bankers’ hands are huge. Thus J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. (including their Philadelphia house, called Drexel &amp; Co.) held on November 1, 1912, deposits aggregating $162,491,819.65”.</em><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

Except for the two years that Clayton clerked for a federal judge after graduating law school, he has worked his entire adult life at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, an elite law firm based in downtown Manhattan that includes many of the country’s largest publicly traded companies as clients. Its sleek Washington, D.C., offices overlook the Washington Monument, where the firm’s attorneys assist banks and other large firms in their business before the Federal Reserve, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the SEC. Clayton, who made $7.6 million in his last year at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, has advised clients on everything from sensitive regulatory problems to initial public offerings to the large-scale mergers and acquisitions that make Page 1 of the business section. Clayton represented the likes of William Ackman and Paul Tudor Jones, some of the most prominent names in the hedge fund world, the very sorts of figures Trump had skewered early in his presidential campaign, saying, “The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder. … I have hedge fund guys that are making a lot of money that aren’t paying anything.”<br><a href="https://archive.is/ReRbV#selection-681.0-689.138">https://archive.is/ReRbV#selection-681.0-689.138</a><br><br>“The Claytons (Current SEC Chairman) own a place in Ocean City, a beach community in southern New Jersey, that Clayton valued at $1 million to $5 million; a rental property there worth more than $1 million; and another property in Philadelphia, worth up to $5 million. And that doesn’t include their 3,000-square-foot loft apartment on Hudson Street, in Manhattan’s Tribeca, which they bought for around $3.2 million in 2006, according to city records. All told, the couple has a net worth of more than $50 million”. <br><a href="https://archive.is/ReRbV#selection-879.0-882.0">https://archive.is/ReRbV#selection-879.0-882.0</a><br><br><br><br><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/30/jay-clayton-sec-donald-trump-wall-street">https://theintercept.com/2018/01/30/jay-clayton-sec-donald-trump-wall-street</a><br></p>

<p>The lions share of Michael Bloomberg's profits originate from the very banks and investments funds that his news organization reports on. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.is/luyYp" target="_blank"><br><br></a>To get an idea of how biased they can be, look no further than his decision to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="block investigative reporting on himself (opens in a new tab)" href="https://archive.is/vJalw" target="_blank">block investigative reporting on himself</a>, and all Democrats, or worse, his apparent subservience to the demands Chinese government, where it was claimed that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="he will bury stories at their request (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theintercept.com/2020/02/18/mike-bloomberg-lp-nda-china/" target="_blank">he will bury stories at their request</a>.<br><br>Now, even in light of all this, it's not completely fair to completely dismiss his credibility simply because of these missteps, because they still do some excellent reporting.  Lest we never forget, it was his network that forced the  banks to disclose the details of the Federal Reserve bailout package during the financial crisis in 2008; something that will forever shed light into the mechanics of central banking. <br><br>One could even go so far as to say this was a revolutionary act, because even though the majority of his profits were derived from these banks, he still fought them anyways, and he should forever be remembered for this.  <br><br>But those were also very trying times.  America had just been brought to its knees by a financial cataclysm that in the words of Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve Chairman at the time, was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="worse than the Great Depression (opens in a new tab)" href="https://interactiveswingtrades.com/2019/09/18/quote-in-2009-ben-bernanke-said-the-2008-financial-crisis-was-worse-than-the-great-depression/" target="_blank">worse than the Great Depression</a>, and at the end of the day, Bloomberg still has <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="competitors (opens in a new tab)" href="https://archive.is/luyYp" target="_blank">competitors</a>.  Most of his profits still derive from these banks, so maybe notwithstanding a financial crisis like we saw in 2008, his decisions will still be highly motivated by this relationship.<br><br>It also wasn't exactly Michael Bloomberg himself that was fighting to  expose the details of that bailout package, but his reporter <a href="https://archive.is/iYdom#selection-2179.0-2198.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Mark Pittman (opens in a new tab)">Mark Pittman</a> -- who died soon after.</p>

This analysis also predicted that fees paid to stock lenders would also increase from an approximate 26% of gross annual stock loan revenue paid to beneficial owners in the current inefficient OTC market to an approximate 52% of gross annual revenue under the efficient, AQS model, netting beneficial owners approximately $1.44 billion more in gross revenues each year"</em><strong><em><br><br>Still facilitated over the counter<br></em></strong><em>"The stock loan market is an “over-the-counter” (“OTC”) market, meaning that there is no central marketplace or exchange through which market participants can send their bids and offers to the entire market or obtain real-time trading data such as price and volume information.
